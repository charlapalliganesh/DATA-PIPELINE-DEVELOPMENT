COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS NAME :CHARLAPALLI GANESH INTERN ID : CT08DF453 DOMAIN : DATA SCIENCE DURATION : 8 WEEKS MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR

Problem Statement
Created a pipeline for data preprocessing, transformation, and loading using tools like pandas and Scikit-learn.

## Project Structure

DATA PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT - Task-1.ipynb
README.md
```

## Features

- Data loading from a source (e.g., CSV file)
- Dropping unnecessary features
- Separating features and target
- Identifying numerical, categorical, and datetime columns
- Ready-to-extend structure for further pipeline steps

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy

##  How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `DATA PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT - Task-1.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run each cell to see how the pipeline is built and modified.
4. You can replace the dataset with your own CSV for experimentation.

## Requirements

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
```

##  Future Improvements

- Add data validation
- Handle missing values
- Feature engineering and encoding
- Pipeline automation using Scikit-learn
